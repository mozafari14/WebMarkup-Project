Hello,
I wanted to explain how I created my HTML and CSS project. In this assignment, I built a structured web page using only semantic HTML elements. Since we’re not allowed to use <div> tags, I replaced them with more meaningful tags like <section>, <nav>, <header>, and <footer> to make the structure clearer and more accessible.
I also organized my CSS file to style each section consistently, focusing on layout, colors, and spacing while keeping the code clean and readable.
Overall, I learned how to write better-structured HTML and how semantic tags improve both accessibility and SEO.
I also want to apologize for not making many commits on GitHub. At first, I didn’t really understand how to use GitHub or what committing meant. We don’t have an assistant for this lesson, so I wasn’t aware that frequent commits were required. I met one of my classmates a few days ago, and he explained that we should commit our code regularly. That’s why I didn’t have many commits earlier — I thought we only needed to check our code in Visual Studio Code and then upload it on Moodle.
I’m sorry for this misunderstanding. Once I learned how to do it, I really tried to make commits as much as I could. I’ll make sure to follow this process correctly in future projects.
