      <h2>Cooking Together, Growing Together</h2>
      <p>In Rotterdam, food is a language that everyone understands. Preparing a meal — it’s more than cooking; it’s
        sharing, laughing, and remembering home. The Asian community in Rotterdam has created beautiful ways to connect
        through food, helping both newcomers and locals feel like they belong.</p>

      <p>Through regular meetups, potluck dinners, and cooking classes, people from different Asian backgrounds share
        their traditional dishes, stories, and experiences.</p>

      <h3>Why Cooking Together Matters</h3>
      <p>Cooking together is more than just food — it creates connection. Many immigrants find comfort and friendship
        through shared cooking spaces and meals. Whether it’s dumpling-making workshops or curry nights, these events
        build a bridge between cultures and generations.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Support cultural understanding and diversity.</li>
        <li>Reduce loneliness and encourage teamwork.</li>
        <li>Help newcomers feel integrated in Rotterdam.</li>
      </ul>
